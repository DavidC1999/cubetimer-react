# Cube timer project to learn react

## Todo list
- [ ] manually enter times
- [ ] computation on settings (having the inspection time in s but use it as ms under the hood, for example)
- [ ] change scramble check in time list to actual pretty modal
- [ ] more scramble types

## Maybe todo list if I feel like it
- [ ] user authentication
- [ ] store times on some backend
